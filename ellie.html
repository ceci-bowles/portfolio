      {% pattern sections/portfolio-piece-description image="#1" heading="Determining the Issue" text="As an assignment, I was responsible for determining what frustrations occur with commercial flying The purpose was to design an app that would help make flying a better experience for passengers. To discover this information and not have bias information a survey was preformed in which participants were asked what was frustrating about travelling by plane and why. The most critical issue found was when all the participants said they missed or almost missed a flight because of really short connection times or because of confusion with their flight information. Participants stated that the best flying experience was because of a smooth process and having minimal stress. It became evident that missing a flight is the biggest cause of frustration and stress among millennials while commercial flying. I undertook finding a solution to this issue." %}

    {% pattern sections/portfolio-piece-description image="#3" heading="The outcome" text="The Feline Caf√© is located in Ottawa and is a foster home for cats without a home, while serving coffee to support the funding and bring customers in to adopt the cats. As a personal project I wanted to think of a way that would be helpful in assisting the company in getting the cats adopted. This required a website redesign that highlighted the service offered and allowed users to meet the cats and learn about them in a fun, interactive banner, rather then just reading a list about them. This lead to an interactive website that the user could click on the cats and learn about them. In the future this could be developed into advertisements and games to promote the company." %}
