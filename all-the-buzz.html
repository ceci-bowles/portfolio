The company needed a strong website to display their wide variety of products in an effective way. They also needed a brand that would speak to their natural methods and pure production. To do this I incorporated a honey comb pattern into the branding. The website also had a informational section that described the honey making process. All the products in the website were split into categories the user could jump to for easy access to it." %}
