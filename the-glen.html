They are well known for their delicious fish’n’chips,their classic menu with a modern twist and their great environment at the location. They also have a food truck that can be found at local events around the city. The initial logo did not  highlight their Scottish background and overall high end quality of service. I designed a new brand that would speak to their roots and reflect on the strong sense of community they provide." %}
