The initial concept had earthy tones and an old school café feel.  The content was too heavy and needed to be easier for the user to follow. It also did not capture the audience’s attention. Later on I had the opportunity to revisit the design. The goal for the new web design was to target it towards a younger audience and allow users to learn about the cats up for adoption without reading a lot of bland information." %}

The banner allows users to get a bit of the personality of the cats and bond with them. This will increase the users time on the website, interacting with the banner. It will also increase the numbers of adoptions because there is another outlet for the store to advertise the cats." %}
