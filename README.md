<!-- Art has always been a piece of my identity, a reflection of myself. I decided to turn my passion into a career so I could help others express their passions and reach their goals. -->

I love stories! I love the drama, the fairy tale endings and the adventure! The journey that leads to a beautiful ride off into the sunset just gets me every time. These stories were my inspiration and support through out my life. I was drawn to become a graphic designer because it gave me the opportunity to tell people's stories through the designs I make and live all these crazy adventures. So let's go on a journey together and make another happily ever after!
